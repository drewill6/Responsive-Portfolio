            <p>Aundrea' Willams (born in the late 1970's), better known as Dre',is happily married and a father of a
                son
                who is
                a junior in college and a daughter who is a senior in high school. Dre' has worked in the medical field
                in
                rehab for over thirteen years running a Home Health and Rehabilitation facility. Dre' also has a
                background
                in
                Chemistry which has somehow led him to persue computer science/programming. Dre's biggest interest in
                programming is developing an application that will allow people to track and maintatin their health and
                fitness
                through meal prepping and exercise. Dre' is just one of these health conscious freaks who walks around
                in
                spandex pants and shirts. He works out in the stairwell and up and down the hallways at work. Dre' has
                this
                vision of reaching out to one million people through word of mouth, without using any form of social
                media
                to
                get themselves healthier. Dre' has been known to ride his bike to work in the morning, which is fifteen
                miles
                from his home just because he knew that he was going to miss the gym that day. Dre' is not the tyoe of
                guy
                who
                plays video games or any game for that matter, but said once he becomes a programmer he plans to by a
                playstation and an xbox and learn to play the most popular game daily for one hour a day until he
                masters
                it
                and learn from it to create his own.</p>
